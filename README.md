# Segmentum - an ETH Prague hackathon app

## Description

üëã Segmentum is aimed at facilitating communication with token-gated communities. It allows you to segment a group of people from your community and airdrop or message them via Blockscan chat. As an example, you may want to communicate only to all your OG token holders who recently minted a POAP at your latest community event and reward them with any form of token for their active participation.

## Disclaimer

In the current form of the tool you could use it easily to spam walllet holders. Anons, play safe, we don't do this here. Later iterations will add spam control, promised ü§û
